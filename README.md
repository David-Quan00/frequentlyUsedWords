# Project: frequentlyUsedWords

For this project, we will take the book, Ars√®ne Lupin by Maurice Leblanc, and extract the top 10 most used words. 

We will makes use of stop words (words that aren't very interesting, such as: 'and', 'the', 'I', 'a',...), and won't include them in our final output.

The book used can be found at: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/6133/6133-0.txt
